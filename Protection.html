			<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
			<h3>Social engineering</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Make sure you know the people working around your desk well and that their intentions are not dangerous.</li>
			  <li>When entering confidential information, including usernames, passwords, and bank information, ensure only you see your screen.</li>
			  <li>Donâ€™t rely on your password being blocked out by asterisks, as this is not the case on some sites.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Phishing</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Look over and analyze every email you read. If it looks off, do not click on any link within the email; report it and delete it.</li>
			  <li>If you do not know the person or company that sent you the email, do not click on any links within the email.</li>
			  <li>If you have clicked on a suspicious link, run an antivirus on your computer. If another site opens asking for information, do not enter any.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Password attacks</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Change passwords frequently.</li>
			  <li>Do not base passwords off other things in your life; base them off nothing if you can and keep a note of them in a secure place.</li>
			  <li>Include special characters like !, ?, /, $ in your password to make it as unguessable as possible.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Malware</h3>
			<p>The removal of malware relies heavily on the use of antivirus software, a piece of software specifically designed for the removal of malware. Most PCs these days come pre-installed with antivirus software. However, stronger ones are available for a fee. Free antimalware software is readily available these days. Be careful when installing these, as sometimes malware can come with them. However, there are some special cases in removing some malware.</p>

			<h3>Spyware</h3>
			<p>Sometimes the best bet for removing spyware is restoring your device to factory settings. This is because spyware software is designed to be stealthy and may often even evade an antivirus. It is worth noting that some spyware can exist even after a hard wipe. If you suspect anything, report it to someone who can help, like an admin of your company or the police.</p>

			<h3>Ransomware</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Avoid paying the ransom if it has already infected your PC at all costs. Funding these cybercriminals is the last thing you want to be doing [1].</li>
			  <li>It is good practice to frequently back up your data on an external source, such as an external hard drive, to be kept unconnected to the PC and free from encryption so that if you get infected with ransomware, your data is not lost.</li>
			</ul>
